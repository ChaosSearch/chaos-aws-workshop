## Visualize

Visualize will allow us to build out different visualizations from the ChaosSearch indices that have been created. The visualizations section has many different options, but we also encourage you to review some of your pre-built visualizations if you need help getting started.

Let&#39;s look at a Visualization that has been created **, AWS ELB - Backend Status Codes.** You can enter the Visualization in the **Search** Bar or expand the rows to 20 and scroll down to it.

Select the Visualization **AWS ELB - Backend Status Codes,** confirm the time frame is 30 days and the filter is NOT backend\_status\_code:200
