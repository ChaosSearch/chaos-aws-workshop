In this workshop we will use ChaosSearch to discover and monitor 404 errors in Elastic Load Balancing Logs (ELB) in S3 on AWS. There will be hands on exercises to:

- Discover ELB Logs and create an Object Group &amp; Index using the Storage tab
- Create a view and transformation in the Refinery tab
- Visualize the data in the view using Kibana
- Monitor and Alert on 404 thresholds using Kibana and Slack

Each participant will use the ID provided in the Workshop details to create objects for each section:

- Object Group = **chaosXX-obj** where XX is your ID
- View = **chaosXX-v** where XX is your ID
- Monitor = **chaosXX-mon** where XX is your ID
- Trigger = **chaosXX-trg** where XX is your ID
- Action = **chaosXX-act** where XX id your ID

Each section will be explained before the exercise and help is available by asking questions in the chat window.

Each section builds upon the last, if you don&#39;t complete a section you can always refer to the Master object:

- Object Group = chaosMSTR-obj
- View = chaosMSTR-v
- Monitor = chaosMSTR-mon
- Trigger = chaosMSTR-trg
- Action = chaosMSTR-act
