ChaoSearch separates compute and storage, where we own the compute and our customers own the storage. Today&#39;s workshop is on AWS and there are some prerequisites that have been met before the workshop started:

- An existing AWS account with S3 bucket privileges
- AWS account access with read/write IAM privileges
- Your **Chaos** Search customer ID for IAM configuration
- **Chaos** Search Email / Password

Using Role Based Access Controls(RBAC) we have already configured each user account. The email and password are in your workshop package.
